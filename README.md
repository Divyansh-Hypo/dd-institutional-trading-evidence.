[Uploading# DD — Public Research Evidence Index (Sanitized)

**Identity:** Divyansh “DD” — aspiring institutional trader (Forex → Crypto) · **AI-augmented researcher** · AI engineer-in-training  
**Focus Stack:** AMT · Volume/Market Profile (POC/VAH/VAL) · TPO · VWAP/dVWAP · Order Flow (Delta/DOM) · VPIN · Python

> This page is a **public summary** of my work. Proprietary details, raw datasets, and private playbooks are **not** shared here.

---

## Coverage & Progress (high level)
- **AMT:** ~80% complete (foundation → execution)  
  Completed: Initiative Order Flow; Responsive Activity; HVN/LVN; Value Area & POC; Market maker behavior (balance/imbalance); Value migration; Accumulation/Distribution; Liquidation phase; Failed auction; Auction rotation; Absorption ratio; Delta/Volume-Delta (through multi-frame alignment).
- **VWAP/dVWAP (13-topic module):** Completed (anchors; session discipline; VWAP Composite Alignment; Structural Delta Flip; Stacked Imbalance; dVWAP core; brand/spreads; vPIN (lite); pullbacks; sponsorship index; entry playbook; exit flip; trail target; computation hygiene).
- **Order Flow:** Structural Delta Flip spec formalized (public summary only).

## Quant/Engineering (public-safe highlights)
- **Control Room (Python):** data ingestion scaffolds, backtesting harness, and dashboard shells (public demo code only).  
- **Journal System:** schema for plan → execution → review with risk metrics (template shared).  
- **Research Ledger:** structure for AI-assisted literature scans, synthesis, and experiment tracking (sample rows only).

## Evidence of Depth (fill-in metrics before publishing)
- Sources reviewed: **__** (papers, articles, videos)  
- Notes written: **__** pages / **__** words  
- Backtests/experiments run: **__** (rolling OOS / walk-forward)  
- Charts annotated: **__**; Sessions journaled: **__**  
- Public commits: **__** (link to GitHub insights)

## Structural Delta Flip — Public Summary
- **Idea:** A regime-change filter using cumulative delta behavior at key auction edges.  
- **Public criteria (sanitized):** sufficient cumulative delta magnitude; break of prior delta swing; occurs at a meaningful edge (e.g., IB/LVN/HVN context); confirmation within limited rotations.  
- **Use:** Gate continuation setups; tighten risk on invalidation.  
*(Full thresholds, examples, and playbook logic kept private.)*

## Playbooks & Checklists (public snippets)
- **Session discipline:** mark POC/VAH/VAL & IB; anchor VWAP/dVWAP; define bias; enforce entry validation (time · location · sponsorship); risk ≤ predefined rotations; journal and score.  
- **Entry/Exit:** public overview only; specifics kept private.

## Links (to be attached as LinkedIn Media)
- GitHub: `dd-institutional-trading-evidence` (public README + non-sensitive demo code)  
- Notion/Drive: Public overview pages (no raw data; “request access” for confidential material)

## What is intentionally not public
- Raw datasets, internal thresholds, proprietary signals, sensitive business plans, and cost spreadsheets.
